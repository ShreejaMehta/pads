# Potentially Accurate Dialogue Synthesis

This project is a demonstration of converting speech to text based dialogues. For the purpose of demonstration, a sample audio file *sampleaudio.wave* has been used.
The program produces three outputs based on different models from which the user can choose the closest output. 

# Modules required
